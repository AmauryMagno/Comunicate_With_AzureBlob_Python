# 💻 Azure Cloud Integration Project

This project demonstrates how to integrate different Azure cloud services with a backend and frontend interface, enabling database operations, blob storage management, and secure environment configuration.

---

## ☁️ Cloud (Azure)

- 🔹 **Service Group Organization**: Structuring services logically within a resource group.
- 📦 **Azure Blob Storage**: Uploading and accessing files securely.
- 🗄️ **Azure SQL Database**: Cloud-based relational database with region and country configuration.
- 🔐 **Secure Access**: Use of `.env` files and SAS tokens to manage credentials and sensitive data securely.

---

## 🗄️ Database

- 🔌 **Connection to Azure SQL**: Establishing and maintaining database connectivity.
- 🌍 **Region/Country Configuration**: Handling geographic data and location-aware setups.
- 🔧 **Database Modifications**: Applying small schema changes for project needs.
- 🔄 **Backend Communication**: Full integration with backend logic for data access and create.

---

## 🖥️ Backend

- 🧠 **Business Logic**: Processing and managing data flow between frontend and database.
- 📬 **Database Requests**: Handling insertions and queries.
- 📁 **Blob Storage Integration**: Managing file uploads and retrieval via Azure Blob.
- ⚙️ **Environment Variables**: Using `.env` to manage DB credentials, blob URLs, and more.

---

## 🎨 Frontend (Streamlit)

- 🧾 **Form Building**: User-friendly form built with **Streamlit** to input and submit data.
- 📤 **Data Submission**: Sending form data to the backend for processing and storage.
- 🖼️ **Blob Uploads**: Uploading and displaying files/images from Azure Blob Storage.
- 📊 **Dynamic Content**: Showing live data from the database in the frontend.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Blob Storage
- pymssql (for DB connection)
- dotenv (`python-dotenv` for environment variables)
